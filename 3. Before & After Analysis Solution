--3. Before & After Analysis
--Solution
/*This technique is usually used when we inspect an important event and want to inspect the impact before and after a certain point in time.

Taking the week_date value of 2020-06-15 as the baseline week where the Data Mart sustainable packaging changes came into effect.

We would include all week_date values for 2020-06-15 as the start of the period after the change and the previous week_date values would be before

Using this analysis approach - answer the following questions:
*/
--What is the total sales for the 4 weeks before and after 2020-06-15? 
/*
SELECT DISTINCT week_number
FROM clean_weekly_sales
WHERE week_date = '2020-06-15' 
  AND calendar_year = '2020';
*/
--What is the growth or reduction rate in actual values and percentage of sales?
